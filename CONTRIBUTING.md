**Welcome to the BIDS Specification repository!**

*We're so excited you're here and want to contribute.*

We hope that these guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved. If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know through one of the many ways to [get in touch](#get-in-touch).

## Joining the community

BIDS - the [Brain Imaging Data Structure][bids] - is a growing community of neuroimaging enthusiasts, and we want to make our resources accessible to and engaging for as many researchers as possible.

We therefore require that all contributions **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.

How do you know that you're a member of the BIDS community? You're here! You know that BIDS exists! You're officially a member of the community. It's THAT easy! Welcome!

## Get in touch

## Contributing through GitHub

[git][git] is a really useful tool for version control. [GitHub][github] sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

We know that it can be daunting to start using git and GitHub if you haven't worked with them in the past, but the BIDS Specification maintainers are here to help you figure out any of the jargon or confusing instructions you encounter!

In order to contribute via GitHub you'll need to set up a free account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to help you get going. Remember that you can ask us any questions you need to along the way.

## Writing in markdown

The specification documents follow the
[Markdown Style Guide](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/). You
can validate your changes against the guide using
[remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint) which works as a
[standalone command line tool](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-cli)
as well as
[a plugin for various text editors](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#editor-integrations).
You can also use [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to
automatically correct some of the style issuse that might be found in the
proposed changes.

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

## Making a change with a pull request

We appreciate all contributions to the BIDS Specification. **THANK YOU** for helping us build this useful resource. 

#### 1. Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition

This allows other members of the BIDS Specification team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.


#### 2. [Fork][github-fork] the [BIDS Starter Kit repository][bids-starterkit-repo] to your profile

This is now your own unique copy of the BIDS Starter Kit. Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][github-syncfork] with the master repository, otherwise you can end up with lots of dreaded [merge conflicts][github-mergeconflicts].

#### 3. Make the changes you've discussed

Try to keep the changes focused. If you submit a large amount of work in all in one go it will be much more work for whomever is reviewing your pull request.

#### 4. Submit a [pull request][github-pullrequest]

A member of the BIDS Specification team will review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main codebase.

A [review][github-review] will probably consist of a few questions to help clarify the work you've done. Keep an eye on your github notifications and be prepared to join in that conversation.

You can update your [fork][github-fork] of the BIDS Specification and the pull request will automatically update with those changes. You don't need to submit a new pull request when you make a change in response to a review.

GitHub has a [nice introduction][github-flow] to the pull request workflow, but please [get in touch](#get-in-touch) if you have any questions.

## Recognizing contributions

BIDS follows the [all-contributors][all-contributors] specification, so we welcome and recognize all contributions from documentation to testing to code development. You can see a list of current contributors in the [BIDS specification][bids-specification].

## Thank you!

You're awesome. :wave::smiley:
