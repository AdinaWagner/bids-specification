# Contributors guide

## Markdown style

The specification documents follow the
[Markdown Style Guide](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/). You
can validate your changes against the guide using
[remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint) which works as a
[standalone command line tool](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-cli)
as well as
[a plugin for various text editors](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#editor-integrations).
You can also use [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to
automatically correct some of the style issuse that might be found in the
proposed changes.
