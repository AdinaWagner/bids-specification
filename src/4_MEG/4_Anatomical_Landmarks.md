Photos of the anatomical landmarks and/or head localization coils on the subjectâ€™s head are RECOMMENDED. If the coils are not placed at the location of actual anatomical landmarks, these latter may be marked with a piece of felt-tip taped to the skin. Please note that the photos may need to be cropped or blurred to conceal identifying features prior to sharing, depending on the terms of the consent form signed by the participant.

Example of the NAS fiducial placed between the eyebrows, rather than at the actual anatomical nasion:
