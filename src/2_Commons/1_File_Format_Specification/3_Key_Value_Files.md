Key/value files (dictionaries)
------------------------------

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files MUST be used for storing key/value pairs. Extensive documentation of the format can be found here: [http://json.org/](http://json.org/).  Several editors have built-in support for JSON syntax highlighting that aids manual creation of such files. An online editor for JSON with built-in validation is available at: [http://jsoneditoronline.org](http://jsoneditoronline.org).Â JSON
files MUST be in UTF-8 encoding.

### 4.3.1 Example:
```JSON
{
  "RepetitionTime": 3,
  "Instruction": "Lie still and keep your eyes open"
}
```
