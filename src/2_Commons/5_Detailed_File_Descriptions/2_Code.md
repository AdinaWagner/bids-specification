Template:
`code/*`

Source code of scripts that were used to prepare the dataset (for example if it was anonymized or defaced) MAY be stored here.<sup>1</sup> Extra care should be taken to avoid including original IDs or any identifiable information with the source code. There are no limitations or recommendations on the language and/or code organization of these scripts at the moment.

<sup>1</sup>Storing actual source files with the data
is preferred over links to external source repositories to maximize long
term preservation (which would suffer if an external repository would
not be available anymore).
