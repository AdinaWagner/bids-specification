Directory structure
=========================

Overall directories hierarchy is

```
sub-<participant_label>/
    [/ses-<session_label>]/
        <data_type>/
[code/]
[derivatives/]
[stimuli/]
[sourcedata/]
```

where square brackets `[]` depicts OPTIONAL content (the same nomenclature is used throughout the spec). Session level is OPTIONAL, first we detail single session example. See below (section 9) for an example with multiple sessions.
